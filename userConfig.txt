/*
Each line specifies a single user entry consisting of a user definition and an action.
   * User definition: [user's name]([number of instances of this user to add to simulation], [seconds user is active])
   * A user action specifies one thing that the user will do during the simulation.

.campaignAction
   .add
      .withAttribution            -number of campaigns to add with attribution
      .withoutAttribution         -number of campaigns to add without attribution
   .view.count                    -number of times to view a randomly selected campaign
   .update
      .addGoal.count              -number of randomly selected campaigns to add an attribution goal to
      .removeGoal.count           -number of randomly selected campaigns to remove an attribution goal from
      .changeName.count           -number of randomly selected campaigns to name-change (new name is randomly generated)
      .addAlerts.count            -number of randomly selected campaigns to enable alerts for
      .removeAlerts.count         -number of randomly selected campaigns to disable alerts for
      .addAd
         .withTag.count           -number of randomly selected campaigns to add an ad to, with a generated tag
         .withoutTag.count        -number of randomly selected campaigns to add ad ad to, without a generated tag
.generateReportAction.count       -number of reports to generate for a randomly selected campaign

EXAMPLE
Here is the configuration for a user named John to be injected 10 times into the simulation over 5 seconds.
Each instance of John will add 1 campaign without attribution, add a goal to 2 randomly selected campaigns,
and generate 4 reports.

John(10, 5).campaignAction.add.withoutAttribution.count = 1
John(10, 5).campaignAction.update.addGoal.count = 2
John(10, 5).generateReportAction.count = 4

NOTES
* Having users with the same name but different numbers (e.g. "John(3, 1)" and "John(2, 4)") will result in a
  simulation error.
* You can use conventional multiline (not single line) comments in this file.
* Everything done in this simulation is run in the active instance of the configured browser in application.conf, or the
  default (first) instance if no previous active instance exists.
* The simulation will actively output (to terminal) virtual user actions as they are completed.
